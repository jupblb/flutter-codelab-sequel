# Flutter codelab sequel

This is a continuation to [Write your first
app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) codelab. It consists of the
following steps:

1.  Use [go_router](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation#using-the-router) for
    URL navigation (thus adding support for using forward/backward buttons).
2.  Split `MyAppState` into two `ChangeNotifiers` and use them with
    [MultiProvider](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple#changenotifierprovider).
